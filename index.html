    <h3>Callback</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Functions that run after certain code has finished.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Promise</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Object that keeps track of whether a certain async event has happened or not
        </li>
        <li>
            Determines what to do after event happens
        </li>
        <li>
            Tells code to expect a future vaule (e.g. data coming back from server)
        </li>
        <h4>Promise Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Promise object is created (and stored in a var). Promise obj watches for a value to be returned in the future. (In the meantime, the next lines of code are run)
            </li>
            <li>
                Data is received (promise is resolved), OR not received (promise is rejected).
            </li>
            <li>
                Programmer tells code what to do after resolution/rejection by calling .then() on the promise object.
            </li>
            <li>
                If another chunk of code needs to be run after the first promise is resolved, another promise can be chained to the previous one by creating a new promise object in the .then() from previous step. The .then() for the new promise should be appended (chained) to the end of the previous .then() to avoid a callback hell type pattern.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
